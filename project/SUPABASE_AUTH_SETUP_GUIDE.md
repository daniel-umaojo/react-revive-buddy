# 🚀 Supabase Auth Integration Setup Guide

Your GlenceGaugeApp has been successfully updated to use **Supabase's built-in authentication system** instead of custom password hashing and manual user table operations. This guide will help you configure Supabase and test the new authentication flow.

## ✅ What's Changed

### 1. **Updated Authentication Service (`supabaseService.ts`)**
- ✅ Now uses `supabase.auth.signUp()` instead of manual user table inserts
- ✅ Password hashing handled automatically by Supabase
- ✅ Email verification handled by Supabase's email service
- ✅ Better error handling with specific error codes
- ✅ Session management with tokens

### 2. **Updated AuthContext (`AuthContext.tsx`)**
- ✅ Handles new response format from Supabase Auth
- ✅ Shows appropriate success/error messages
- ✅ Detects when email verification is required

### 3. **Updated AuthPage (`AuthPage.tsx`)**
- ✅ Handles email verification links automatically via URL parameters
- ✅ Shows verification status and improved error messages
- ✅ Better user experience with loading states

## 🔧 Supabase Configuration Required

### Step 1: Enable Email Authentication

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**
   - Navigate to: `Authentication > Settings > Email`

2. **Configure Email Settings**
   ```
   ✅ Enable email confirmations: ON
   ✅ Secure email change: ON (recommended)
   ✅ Double confirm email changes: ON (recommended)
   ```

3. **Set Email Redirect URLs**
   ```
   Site URL: http://localhost:5173 (for development)
   Additional redirect URLs:
   - http://localhost:5173/
   - http://localhost:5173/?*
   - https://your-production-domain.com (when deploying)
   ```

### Step 2: Configure Email Templates (Optional)

1. **Navigate to**: `Authentication > Email Templates`
2. **Customize the "Confirm signup" template** if desired
3. **Default template works fine** - users will get a verification email with a link

### Step 3: RLS Policies (Current Status)

Your current database setup has **RLS disabled** for testing. For production, you may want to:

```sql
-- Enable RLS on auth-related tables if needed
ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policies that work with Supabase Auth
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own data" ON users
FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid()::text = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own data" ON users
FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid()::text = id);
```
